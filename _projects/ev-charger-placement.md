Developed an end-to-end pipeline connecting an RL client with a Java-based server component for EV charger placement optimization.

What this includes:
- Client/server interface for iterative optimization
- Experiment tooling to compare strategies
- Emphasis on reproducible runs and configuration-driven experiments
