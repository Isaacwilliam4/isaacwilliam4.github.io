I’m Isaac Peterson — a Robotic Simulation Developer and Graduate Research Assistant at Utah State University. My work centers on scalable simulation and learning systems for multi-agent robotics, with a focus on reinforcement learning and high-fidelity physics environments (Isaac Lab).

I enjoy building end-to-end pipelines that connect simulation, learning, evaluation, and deployment-ready tooling — and keeping everything reproducible with clean engineering practices.
